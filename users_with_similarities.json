Members of the First Round Capital Community have raised over $2.5 billion in follow-on capital to date. First Rounds's $20 million in total initial investments (in those companies that have been in the portfolio for over a year) have been followed by $850 million in financing from later-stage venture firms - a roughly 36-1 ratio.",
